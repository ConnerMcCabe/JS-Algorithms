An Algorithm a day keeps the Corona at bay, with the occaisional notes mixed in
### D1- PigLatin
    a function that takes a string, and returns a string that removes the first character and adds it to the end followed by '-ay'
    ex; pigLt('bolster') => 'olsterbay'
    ex; pigLt('cat') => 'atcay'
### D2- Palindromes
    a function that takes a string, to sees if the letters are the same order if reversed, returns a boolean
    ex; isPalindrome('taco cat') => true
### D3- Big O


## Notes
recursion vs iterative
    What is recursion? how is it used
        a function that calls itself over and over again
        one problem, do it over and over again on a smaller or changing piece until you hit an end point, the base case
    2 components that make up a recursive function
    How to visualize the call stack to better understand and debug recursive functions
