### Data Structures
Data Structures + Algorithms = programs
DataStructures- a collection of values, Algorithms- the steps we use to manipulate values
DataStructures- how to build one/ how to use it

## Arrays- 
also known as lists, stored in contiguous memory. If all you need is to store data and iterate over it, this is a good choice
fairly slow if you don't know exactly where you are going and have to search for something

## Hash tables- 
aka- maps (send key -> hash function -> maps hash into memory address -> where data is stored) 
what is a hash function, it generates a value of fixed length for each input that it gets; turns conent into ordered gibberish (ex: hashing a password so that it is recoverable but still protected)
key- to find items in memory, values can be asigned a key in the table although running through a hash function adds to TC
### Time Complexities of Hash Tables methods
  insert- O(1)
  lookup- O(1)
  delete- O(1)
  search- O(1)

Linked lists
Stacks/ Queues
Trees
Tries
Graphs
