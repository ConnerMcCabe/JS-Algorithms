## Time Complexity
Big O, asymptotic analysis- what is it? what are time complexities? It is useful in the analysis of algorithms and determining efficiency over time. How well was the problem solved, in coding there is often many ways to solve a problem and Big O allows us to objectively determine what is a "better" solution; it tells us, in simplified terms, how long an algorithm takes to run. So what is good code? it is 1. [readable] and 2. [scaleable] (the scaleable part is where Big O factors in, or how many steps will it take for a machine to run the code while factoring in speed and memory)

for simplicity it is reduced to a few base cases
* O(1)- just the time it takes to do a single action
* O(n)- 
* n- basically a one to one
* O(n²)- 
* O(2↑n)- O of 2 to the Nth power; takes forever,a brute force solution

## Recursion
recursion vs iterative
    What is recursion? how is it used
        a function that calls itself over and over again
        one problem, do it over and over again on a smaller or changing piece until you hit an end point, the base case
    2 components that make up a recursive function
    How to visualize the call stack to better understand and debug recursive functions

Sorting
Dynamic Programming
BFS + DFS (Searching)
